# Remember Me
A collaborative repository focused in store tricky/cool/straightfoward shell commands, shellscripts, system setups, docs, etc.

In 21st century, no dev workers have to struggle against search engines looking for a easy way to do a one-time simple job, or spend time developing scripts in languages you are not fluent, or even remember absolutely all commands that can't live in `history` anymore and so, being frustrated because you brain say NO!. Let the repetition process store only the most relevant in your mind, and paste here what could be volatile.

Yes, this is one of thousands repos with the same or similar subject. As collaborative ecosystem, GitHub let's you free to contribute in bigger or smaller projects than this. Remember Me is just one more, and right now it means a lab to a Junior dev guy and who feel it worth a little bit of her/his precious time.

### How it's organize

In a classical directory tree, grouped by types, main tech area, etc. As first level we have shell commands, shellscripts, system/services setups and docs for now. When a task goes to simple set of commands (inline preferred), it should be paste into a Markdown doc. When a task goes to more complex and repetitive process, it should be added as understandable shellscript with comments. Setups and Config processes should follow the same rules os shellscripts, followed by an internal README to guide manual configuration process. About docs, they should contain more natural language as tutorials', in well-consolidated recipes format, with good explanations and developed concepts when presents.

For now, if you have any doubts about it, follow the flow... :wink:

### How to submit your precious info

I guess the proper GitHub tool for this is Pull Request, but, sincerely, as a lab I truly hope discover this under demand with who will land here.
